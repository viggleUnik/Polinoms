# Polinoms
A Java application that can solve a series of major operations on polynomials with full 
coefficients via an interface. Following implementation, our application is able to:
 1 . Read two polynomials entered from the keyboard and display a result polynomial and 
 one that will constitute the rest of the division (if done) in a user-friendly format
Ex: + 3x ^ 4 + 4x ^ 3-9x ^ 2 + 10x
Â 2. Perform polynomial operations, namely: adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing 
 two polynomials (we will call them operations with 2 parameters), but also operations 
 that apply to a single polynomial, such as integration and derivation of the first order 
 (we will call them 1 parameter operations).
 3. Presents a graphical interface that will be implemented with the help of the Swing 
 library and will facilitate the use of the program
